# Atom Product Requirements Document

## Status: Draft
## Date: 2026-04-27

---

## Summary

Atom is a lightweight identity and access service for Magistrala and other cloud-native or edge systems.

It replaces a large external identity provider such as Keycloak with a single Rust binary backed by one PostgreSQL database.

Atom provides three main product areas:

1. **Entity management**

   Atom manages the objects that participate in identity and access control:

   - entities: humans, devices, services, workloads, and applications;
   - tenants: isolation boundaries such as Magistrala domains;
   - groups: collections of entities used for shared access;
   - resources: protected application objects such as channels;
   - roles: reusable bundles of capabilities;
   - credentials: passwords, API keys, and future credential types;
   - ownerships: parent-child relationships between entities.

2. **Authentication**

   Atom verifies who the caller is:

   - password login;
   - JWT sessions;
   - API keys;
   - credential revocation;
   - session tracking;
   - JWKS for external JWT verification;
   - signing key rotation.

3. **Authorization / access control**

   Atom decides what the caller can do:

   - capabilities;
   - roles;
   - policy bindings;
   - RBAC;
   - ABAC;
   - group-based access;
   - `POST /authz/check`;
   - `POST /authz/explain`;
   - access query endpoints;
   - audit logs.

Applications such as Magistrala store product-specific metadata in `attributes`. Runtime services call Atom for authorization decisions instead of embedding permissions in tokens. Operators use Atom's query APIs to understand access, debug denials, and keep the policy graph clean.

---

## Problem

Magistrala and similar IoT platforms need identity and authorization for humans, devices, services, workloads, applications, domains, channels, and other resources. Keycloak can solve parts of this, but it is operationally heavy and does not map cleanly to IoT-native authorization questions.

The current project needs a single PRD because the important product intent is spread across code, API docs, `spec.md`, and endpoint-specific product docs. Without a consolidated requirements document, it is easy to miss major decisions:

- there is no special user type;
- tenants are first-class isolation boundaries;
- Magistrala domains map directly to Atom tenants;
- tokens do not carry permissions;
- denies override allows;
- audit and explainability are product requirements, not optional diagnostics;
- query endpoints are required for operating the system, not just for convenience.

---

## Goals

1. Provide a compact identity and authorization service that is simple to deploy, operate, and reason about.
2. Support humans, devices, services, workloads, and applications using one consistent entity model.
3. Support password login, JWT sessions, API keys, and future credential types without changing the core entity model.
4. Provide policy-based authorization with RBAC, ABAC, direct grants, group grants, and deny-overrides semantics.
5. Make tenants first-class isolation boundaries, with Magistrala domains mapping directly to Atom tenants.
6. Keep authorization online: every access decision is evaluated against current database state.
7. Provide explain, access listing, audit, and hygiene endpoints so operators can understand and maintain access state.
8. Expose both HTTP and gRPC interfaces for runtime integration.
9. Keep the implementation small: one binary, one Postgres database, automatic migrations.

## Non-goals

1. Atom is not a full Keycloak clone.
2. Atom does not provide a hosted login UI in the current scope.
3. Atom does not implement OAuth/OIDC federation in the current scope.
4. Atom does not provide SCIM provisioning in the current scope.
5. Atom does not embed permissions into JWTs.
6. Atom does not replace application domain models; application-specific fields remain in `attributes`.
7. Atom does not require GraphQL or a general-purpose policy language in the current scope.

## Users

### Platform operator

Runs Atom, configures tenants, rotates credentials, inspects audit logs, and cleans up stale policies.

Needs:

- predictable deployment;
- simple bootstrap admin path;
- auditability;
- admin-only management APIs;
- hygiene reports for broken policy state.

### Application backend

Calls Atom from Magistrala or another service to create identities, create resources, bind policies, and check authorization at runtime.

Needs:

- low-latency `check` and bulk check APIs;
- stable HTTP and gRPC contracts;
- domain objects expressible as Atom tenants/resources/entities;
- deterministic authorization semantics.

### Security administrator

Manages roles, groups, policies, and incident investigations.

Needs:

- "why was access denied?";
- "who can access this resource?";
- "what can this entity do?";
- "who holds this role?";
- "which policies are orphaned or risky?".

### Magistrala integrator

Maps Magistrala users, clients, groups, domains, and channels to Atom primitives.

Needs:

- direct domain-to-tenant mapping;
- client API keys;
- channel publish/subscribe checks;
- group and role based authorization;
- Magistrala metadata preserved under `attributes.magistrala`.

---

## Product Principles

1. **Entity first**: every principal is an entity. `human`, `device`, `service`, `workload`, and `application` are kinds of the same object.
2. **Tenant as boundary**: a tenant is an isolation boundary, not a principal. Global objects use `tenant_id = null`.
3. **Online authorization**: tokens authenticate identity; they do not authorize actions.
4. **Default deny**: no matching allow policy means denied.
5. **Deny overrides allow**: a matching deny policy wins immediately.
6. **Composable access**: direct grants, roles, groups, scopes, and ABAC conditions can combine.
7. **Explainable operations**: every important access question should be answerable through Atom APIs.
8. **Application metadata stays namespaced**: application-owned fields live in `attributes`, for example `attributes.magistrala`.
9. **Operational simplicity**: one binary, one database, migrations on startup.

---

## Core Concepts

### Tenant

A tenant is a first-class isolation boundary with `name`, optional `route`, `tags`, `attributes`, lifecycle status, and audit fields.

Status values:

- `active`
- `inactive`
- `frozen`
- `deleted`

Entities, groups, resources, and roles can be scoped to a tenant through `tenant_id`. Magistrala domains map directly to Atom tenants; the Magistrala domain UUID should be reused as `tenants.id`.

When a tenant is created, Atom must bootstrap tenant administration:

- create a tenant-scoped role named `tenant-admin`;
- grant that role tenant administration capability for the created tenant;
- bind that role to the entity that created the tenant.

The generated `tenant-admin` role is the starting administrative role for that tenant. It is not a hardcoded global role. A tenant admin can later create other tenant-scoped roles such as `tenant-manager`, `operator`, `viewer`, or `auditor`.

Tenant lifecycle affects authorization. If a tenant is `inactive`, `frozen`, or `deleted`, Atom must deny authorization checks for objects inside that tenant and return a reason that includes the tenant state.

Example reasons:

```text
tenant is inactive
tenant is frozen
tenant is deleted
```

### Platform Policy Inheritance

`platform` is the top of the scope hierarchy. A grant with `scope_kind = platform` inherits into every tenant for the same capability, just as a tenant grant inherits into objects whose `tenant_id` matches the tenant.

Examples:

- `platform` + `manage` → super admin. Manage every platform-level object and, through inheritance, every object in every tenant.
- `platform` + `tenant.manage` → tenant lifecycle manager. Create, update, freeze, and delete any tenant. Does not inherit into objects inside tenants.
- `platform` + `audit.read` → read every audit log across the platform and every tenant.

Platform inheritance applies per capability. A platform grant of one capability does not extend to other capabilities through inheritance.

### Tenant Policy Inheritance

A tenant policy can be used to grant access over objects inside a tenant.

The core rule is:

```text
If a subject has capability X on tenant T,
then the subject may use capability X on tenant-scoped objects where tenant_id = T.
```

Example:

```text
Alice has manage on tenant factory-1
```

This can allow Alice to manage objects inside `factory-1`, such as:

- entities in `factory-1`;
- groups in `factory-1`;
- resources in `factory-1`;
- roles in `factory-1`;
- policies in `factory-1`;
- credentials for tenant-scoped entities in `factory-1`;
- audit logs associated with `factory-1`.

Tenant policy inheritance must never apply to:

- another tenant's objects;
- global platform objects where `tenant_id = null`;
- platform-wide administration such as signing key rotation;
- global capabilities or global guardrail rules unless separately allowed by platform policy.

There are two possible models for tenant policy inheritance.

#### Option A: Equal Inheritance

In this model, tenant capabilities apply equally to all tenant-scoped object types.

Example:

```text
manage on tenant = manage everything inside the tenant
read on tenant = read everything inside the tenant
```

If Alice has `manage` on tenant `factory-1`, she can manage:

- tenant entities;
- tenant groups;
- tenant resources;
- tenant roles;
- tenant policies;
- tenant-scoped credentials;
- tenant audit logs.

Benefits:

- simple to explain;
- simple to implement;
- useful for MVP;
- easy for platform admins to reason about;
- matches the common expectation of a tenant admin.

Risks:

- broad access;
- `read` on a tenant may include sensitive objects such as audit logs or credential metadata;
- `manage` on a tenant may allow powerful operations such as policy changes and credential revocation;
- mistakes in one tenant-level policy can affect many object types.

#### Option B: Sensitive Object Capabilities

In this model, tenant policy inheritance applies broadly, but sensitive object types require specific capabilities.

Example:

```text
manage on tenant = manage normal tenant objects
read_audit on tenant = read tenant audit logs
manage_credentials on tenant = manage tenant credentials
manage_policies on tenant = manage tenant policies
```

Under this model, Alice may have `manage` on tenant `factory-1`, but still need explicit capabilities to:

- read audit logs;
- revoke credentials;
- create or delete tenant policies;
- create another tenant admin;
- view sensitive credential metadata.

Benefits:

- safer;
- clearer security boundaries;
- easier to give limited roles such as tenant viewer, support user, auditor, or credential operator.

Costs:

- more capabilities;
- more policy complexity;
- more UI/API decisions;
- harder to implement correctly in the first version.

#### MVP Choice

For tenant administration, Atom uses a split model:

```text
manage on tenant grants administration over normal tenant-scoped objects.
Sensitive tenant operations require explicit sensitive capabilities.
```

This means the generated `tenant-admin` role should include:

- `manage` on the tenant;
- `audit.read` for tenant audit logs;
- `credential.manage` for credentials of tenant-scoped entities;
- `policy.manage` for tenant-owned policies;
- `role.manage` for tenant-scoped roles.

The seeded `tenant-admin` role intentionally does not include `tenant.manage`. A tenant admin cannot rename, freeze, or delete their own tenant; those operations require a platform admin holding `tenant.manage` with `scope_kind = platform`. If self-service tenant metadata management is needed later, `tenant.manage` can be added to the role with scope set to the role's owning tenant.

With those capabilities, a tenant admin can manage:

- entities in the tenant through `manage`;
- groups in the tenant through `manage`;
- resources in the tenant through `manage`;
- roles in the tenant through `role.manage`;
- policies in the tenant through `policy.manage`;
- credentials for tenant-scoped entities through `credential.manage`;
- audit logs for the tenant through `audit.read`.

Tenant credential access follows entity scope:

- a tenant admin can manage credentials for tenant-scoped entities in that tenant;
- a tenant admin cannot manage credentials for global human users with `tenant_id = null` unless separately allowed by platform policy;
- a tenant admin cannot manage platform admin credentials unless separately allowed by platform policy.

However, broad tenant inheritance is intended for tenant administration, mainly by `human` and trusted `service` entities. It should not be used as the normal model for device runtime access.

Device and workload runtime permissions should normally be granted through explicit resource, resource-kind, role, or group policies.

Example:

```text
Good:
device sensor-1 has publish on channel temperature

Good:
group floor-sensors has publish on resource_kind channel

Risky:
device sensor-1 has publish on tenant factory-1
```

The risky form may be allowed only if capability assignment guardrails permit it. By default, guardrails should prevent devices from receiving broad tenant-level administration capabilities such as `manage`, `write`, or `delete`.

### Entity

An entity is any principal that can authenticate or be authorized.

Kinds:

- `human`
- `device`
- `service`
- `workload`
- `application`

An entity has a name, optional tenant, status, and JSON attributes. The `tenant_id` on an entity means ownership or home tenant, not access membership.

Tenant ownership and tenant membership are different concepts:

```text
tenant_id = this object belongs to this tenant
tenant membership = this human participates in this tenant
```

For devices, services, workloads, applications, groups, resources, roles, policies, and audit logs, `tenant_id` should represent tenant ownership or boundary.

Examples:

```text
sensor-1 belongs to factory-1
channel-1 belongs to factory-1
role operator belongs to factory-1
group floor-sensors belongs to factory-1
```

This direct `tenant_id` model keeps tenant filtering, uniqueness, lifecycle enforcement, and authorization checks simple.

Human users are different because a single person may participate in many tenants. Human users are global by default:

```text
alice@example.com
kind = human
tenant_id = null
```

Alice can administer or access one or more tenants through policy bindings without becoming tenant-scoped:

```text
Alice has tenant-admin on factory-1
Alice has tenant-viewer on factory-2
```

The MVP must not duplicate the same human as separate tenant-local entities. Duplicating humans creates login ambiguity, split audit history, duplicate credentials, and confusing policy behavior.

For tenant-local human profile, invitation, and membership status, Atom uses a dedicated tenant membership table rather than replacing `tenant_id` everywhere.

Tenant membership shape:

```sql
tenant_memberships (
  tenant_id   uuid not null,
  entity_id   uuid not null,
  status      text not null,
  local_name  text null,
  attributes  jsonb not null default '{}',
  created_at  timestamptz not null default now(),
  primary key (tenant_id, entity_id)
)
```

This table is used for human participation, tenant-local profile, tenant-local status, and invitation lifecycle. It does not replace direct `tenant_id` ownership for devices, resources, groups, roles, policies, or audit logs.

Entity is the principal model. Some entities can also be protected objects when another entity manages them.

Examples:

- `sensor-1` publishes to `temperature-channel`
  - `sensor-1` is the acting entity.
  - `temperature-channel` is the protected resource.
  - `publish` is the action.
- `alice` updates `sensor-1` metadata
  - `alice` is the acting entity.
  - `sensor-1` is the protected object being managed.
  - `write` or `manage` is the action.
- `tenant-admin` disables `device-1`
  - `tenant-admin` is the acting entity.
  - `device-1` is also an entity, but in this request it is the protected object.
  - Tenant-level administration rules decide whether the action is allowed.

This avoids treating every manageable entity as a separate application resource. The same record can act as a subject in one request and be protected as an object in another request.

Entity subtypes are not separate protected object kinds. Atom should use `object_kind = "entity"` plus an entity-kind filter when a policy or authorization check targets humans, devices, services, workloads, or applications.

Examples:

```text
Alice can manage all devices in tenant A
```

is represented as:

```text
subject = Alice
action = manage
object_kind = entity
entity_kind = device
tenant_id = tenant A
```

```text
Alice can manage one specific device
```

is represented as:

```text
subject = Alice
action = manage
object_kind = entity
entity_kind = device
object_id = device entity UUID
```

Human-facing APIs and UI may label this as "device access", but internally the protected object is still an entity with `kind = device`.

### Credential

A credential belongs to an entity.

Kinds:

- `password`
- `api_key`
- `certificate`

Password and API key secrets are argon2-hashed. API keys use the format:

```text
atom_<32-hex-credential-id>_<64-hex-secret>
```

The plaintext API key is revealed once and must not be recoverable later.

Certificate credentials are schema-supported but behavior-deferred for now. The MVP should not build full certificate issuance, verification, rotation, or mTLS identity flows. Full certificate credentials remain a future extension.

Credential management authority follows the entity's `tenant_id`, not tenant membership:

- A tenant admin may manage credentials only for entities owned by that tenant (`entity.tenant_id = <tenant>`).
- A tenant admin must not manage credentials for entities owned by another tenant.
- A tenant admin must not manage credentials for global entities (`tenant_id = null`), even if the global entity participates in that tenant through `tenant_memberships`. Membership grants presence and access in a tenant; it does not grant the tenant's admin credential authority over the member.
- Credentials of global entities can be managed only by a platform admin, unless platform policy explicitly delegates credential authority over a specific global entity to a specific tenant admin.
- This rule applies to all credential operations: create, rotate, revoke, and read.

### Session and JWT

Login creates a session and returns a JWT. JWTs identify the entity and session. JWTs may include tenant context, but must not carry permissions.

### Resource

A resource is an application object protected by authorization, such as a channel, device, workspace, secret, node, or any other object kind.

Resources have a kind, optional name, optional tenant, optional owner, and attributes.

### Group

A group is a named collection of entities. Policies can bind to groups, and group members inherit those policy bindings.

### Capability

A capability is an atomic permission such as:

- `read`
- `create`
- `write`
- `update`
- `delete`
- `publish`
- `subscribe`
- `execute`
- `manage`
- `list`
- `credential.manage`
- `credential.revoke`
- `signing_key.rotate`
- `audit.read`
- `policy.manage`
- `role.manage`
- `tenant.manage`

A capability may apply globally or to one resource kind.

Capabilities are not limited to the list above. The seeded set should cover common platform, tenant administration, and runtime use cases. Product-specific capabilities may be added by platform administrators.

Recommended capability groups:

| Group | Capabilities | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| General object access | `read`, `list`, `create`, `write`, `update`, `delete`, `manage` | Administrative CRUD and object management |
| Messaging/runtime | `publish`, `subscribe`, `execute` | Device, workload, and service runtime operations |
| Credentials and keys | `credential.manage`, `credential.revoke`, `signing_key.rotate` | Credential lifecycle and key rotation |
| Access control | `policy.manage`, `role.manage` | Policy and role administration |
| Tenant administration | `tenant.manage`, `manage` | Tenant lifecycle and tenant-scoped administration |
| Audit | `audit.read` | Audit log access |

Devices should normally receive only runtime-oriented capabilities such as `publish`, `subscribe`, and limited `read` for configuration or state. Devices should not receive administrative capabilities such as `manage`, `create`, `write`, `update`, or `delete` by default.

### Object Kinds

Every protected object is described by a (kind, type) pair.

The **kind** (`object_kind`) is the broad category. The canonical set is:

- `entity`
- `resource`
- `group`
- `tenant`
- `role`
- `policy`
- `credential`
- `audit_log`

`capability` is a definition rather than a protected runtime object and is not in this set; capability mutation is governed by `policy.manage` and `role.manage`.

The **type** (`object_type`) is the finer sub-kind, written as `<kind>:<sub-kind>`:

- entity sub-kinds: `entity:human`, `entity:device`, `entity:service`, `entity:workload`, `entity:application`
- resource sub-kinds: `resource:channel`, `resource:<app-defined>`

For kinds without sub-kinds (`group`, `tenant`, `role`, `policy`, `credential`, `audit_log`), `object_type` is null.

The kind prefix on `object_type` is intentionally redundant with `object_kind` so that audit logs and explain output are self-describing. Bare values such as `device` or `channel` must not appear as `scope_ref`, as a stored `object_type`, or in audit records.

These values must be used consistently across policy scopes, guardrail rules, authorization checks, and audit logs.

### Role

A role is a named bundle of capabilities, optionally scoped to a tenant.

### Policy Binding

A policy binding grants or denies a capability or role to an entity or group over a scope.

Policy fields:

- `tenant_id`: tenant that owns the policy binding, or `null` for global platform policy
- `subject_kind`: `entity` or `group`
- `subject_id`: entity or group UUID
- `grant_kind`: `capability` or `role`
- `grant_id`: capability or role UUID
- `scope_kind`: `platform`, `tenant`, `object_kind`, `object_type`, or `object`
- `scope_ref`: tenant UUID, object kind, object type, or object UUID when needed
- `effect`: `allow` or `deny`
- `conditions`: flat JSON object of ABAC dot-path conditions

Policy bindings should store `tenant_id` directly. Inferring tenant ownership from subject, role, resource scope, or conditions is too ambiguous for tenant administration, query APIs, guardrails, and audit.

Rules:

- `tenant_id = null` means platform/global policy.
- `tenant_id = <tenant>` means tenant-owned policy.
- tenant admins can manage policies only for their tenant.
- global/platform policies require platform-level permission.
- a tenant-owned policy must not grant access outside its tenant unless explicitly allowed by platform policy.

Policy scope meanings:

| Scope kind | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `platform` | Top of the scope hierarchy. Applies to platform-level objects and inherits into every tenant for the same capability. | platform admin (`manage`), tenant lifecycle manager (`tenant.manage`) |
| `tenant` | Applies to one tenant and, through tenant inheritance, tenant-scoped objects | manage tenant `factory-1` |
| `object_kind` | Applies to all objects of a kind in the policy boundary | manage all entities in tenant A |
| `object_type` | Applies to a subtype of an object kind | manage all `entity:device` objects in tenant A |
| `object` | Applies to one specific object ID | manage one device entity |

`object_type` is always namespaced with its kind as the prefix, joined by a colon:

```text
entity:human
entity:device
entity:service
entity:workload
entity:application
resource:channel
resource:<app-defined>
```

Bare values such as `device` or `channel` must not appear as `scope_ref` or as a stored `object_type`. For kinds without sub-kinds (`group`, `tenant`, `role`, `policy`, `credential`, `audit_log`), `object_type` is null.

Examples:

```text
manage all entities in tenant A
scope_kind = object_kind
scope_ref = entity
tenant_id = tenant A
```

```text
manage all devices in tenant A
scope_kind = object_type
scope_ref = entity:device
tenant_id = tenant A
```

```text
manage one specific device
scope_kind = object
scope_ref = <device entity UUID>
```

### ABAC Conditions

Policy bindings may include `conditions`. Conditions are a flat JSON object where keys are dot-paths. Each value is either a literal (treated as `eq`) or an object specifying an operator. All conditions must match for the policy binding to apply.

Supported operators:

- `eq` — value equals the operand (default for a literal value).
- `neq` — value does not equal the operand.
- `contains` — for strings, substring match; for arrays, element membership.
- `in` — value is one of the operands (operand is an array).
- `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte` — numeric or timestamp comparison.

Operator example:

```json
{
  "context.mfa_verified": true,
  "object.attributes.tags": { "contains": "production" },
  "context.time": { "gte": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" },
  "entity.attributes.department": { "in": ["operations", "security"] }
}
```

If a referenced field is missing on the subject, object, tenant, or context, the condition does not match and the policy binding does not apply.

ABAC conditions may reference three categories of data:

1. **Top-level fields**

   These are real fields from Atom's domain objects. They should not need to be duplicated inside JSON attributes.

   Examples:

   ```text
   entity.id
   entity.kind
   entity.tenant_id
   entity.status
   resource.id
   resource.kind
   resource.tenant_id
   tenant.id
   tenant.status
   object.kind
   object.type
   object.id
   object.tenant_id
   ```

2. **Attributes**

   These are JSON fields stored under `attributes` on entities, resources, tenants, and protected objects.

   Examples:

   ```text
   entity.attributes.department
   entity.attributes.region
   resource.attributes.env
   resource.attributes.site
   tenant.attributes.plan
   object.attributes.magistrala.tags
   ```

3. **Request context**

   These are values supplied by the caller during an authorization check.

   Examples:

   ```text
   context.ip
   context.method
   context.client_id
   context.mfa_verified
   context.time
   ```

Example condition:

```json
{
  "entity.kind": "human",
  "entity.attributes.department": "operations",
  "object.type": "entity:device",
  "object.attributes.site": "plant-a",
  "tenant.status": "active",
  "context.mfa_verified": true
}
```

This means:

```text
Apply this policy only when a human from operations is acting on a device at plant-a, inside an active tenant, after MFA verification.
```

Top-level fields and attributes are both required. Top-level fields provide stable system facts such as kind, tenant, status, and object type. Attributes provide application-specific facts such as department, region, tags, site, plan, or Magistrala metadata.

### Capability Assignment Guardrails

Capabilities are generic. Entity kind describes what the subject is, but entity kind should not directly grant permissions.

Runtime authorization answers:

```text
Can subject X do action Y on object Z?
```

Capability assignment guardrails answer a different question:

```text
Is it safe to create this policy, role binding, role capability, or group membership?
```

This prevents unsafe access from being created accidentally.

Example:

- A `device` should usually be allowed to `publish` to a `channel`.
- A `device` should usually not be allowed to `create`, `write`, `delete`, or `manage` a `channel`.
- A `human` or trusted `service` may be allowed to manage tenant resources if a policy grants it.
- A tenant may define stricter local rules, but platform-level absolute denies cannot be overridden by a tenant.

The PDP stays generic and policy-based. Guardrails run when access is assigned or changed.

Guardrails should be evaluated when:

- creating a policy binding;
- binding a role to an entity;
- binding a role to a group;
- adding a capability to a role;
- adding an entity to a group that already has policies;
- creating tenant-scoped admin roles during tenant creation.

Direct grants, role grants, and group grants must all be validated. Otherwise an unsafe grant can be hidden inside a role or inherited through a group.

Recommended storage:

```sql
capability_assignment_rules (
  id              uuid primary key,
  tenant_id       uuid null,
  entity_kind     text not null,
  capability_name text not null,
  object_kind     text not null,
  object_type     text null,
  decision        text not null check (decision in ('allow', 'deny', 'require_override')),
  is_absolute     boolean not null default false,
  created_at      timestamptz not null default now()
)
```

Field meaning:

- `tenant_id = null` means the rule is a global default.
- `tenant_id = <tenant>` means the rule applies only inside that tenant.
- `entity_kind` is the kind of the subject receiving access.
- `capability_name` is the action being granted.
- `object_kind` is the protected object type, such as `resource`, `entity`, `group`, `tenant`, `role`, `policy`, `credential`, or `audit_log`.
- `object_type` narrows the rule to a specific sub-kind such as `resource:channel` or `entity:device`. Always namespaced with its kind. Null means the rule applies to every sub-kind under the given `object_kind`.
- `decision = allow` means the assignment is allowed.
- `decision = deny` means the assignment is rejected.
- `decision = require_override` means only a platform admin can force the assignment, and the override must be audited.
- `is_absolute = true` means the rule cannot be overridden by tenant-specific rules.

Guardrail management rules:

- platform admins manage global guardrail rules;
- tenant admins may create tenant-specific guardrail rules only for their tenant;
- for MVP, tenant admins may only make tenant-specific rules stricter, such as adding deny rules;
- tenant admins cannot override global absolute deny rules;
- tenant admins cannot create global guardrails.

Example global rules:

| Entity kind | Capability | Object kind | Object type | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `device` | `publish` | `resource` | `resource:channel` | `allow` |
| `device` | `subscribe` | `resource` | `resource:channel` | `allow` |
| `device` | `manage` | `resource` | `resource:channel` | `deny` |
| `device` | `delete` | `resource` | `resource:channel` | `deny` |
| `human` | `manage` | `resource` | `resource:channel` | `allow` |
| `service` | `manage` | `resource` | `resource:channel` | `allow` |

Example tenant-specific rule:

| Tenant | Entity kind | Capability | Object kind | Object type | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `factory-1` | `device` | `read` | `resource` | `resource:device_config` | `allow` |

Recommended rule precedence:

1. Global absolute deny.
2. Global absolute require override.
3. Tenant deny.
4. Tenant require override.
5. Tenant allow.
6. Global deny.
7. Global require override.
8. Global allow.
9. Default deny.

This means tenants can become stricter than the platform defaults. Tenants can add local allows only where the platform has not declared an absolute deny.

Example rejected policy:

```json
{
  "subject_kind": "entity",
  "subject_id": "device-id",
  "grant_kind": "capability",
  "grant_id": "delete-channel-capability-id",
  "scope_kind": "object_type",
  "scope_ref": "resource:channel"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "error": "capability_not_allowed_for_entity_kind",
  "message": "device entities cannot be granted delete on resource kind channel by default"
}
```

Example role validation:

- Role `channel-admin` contains `delete` on `channel`.
- A policy tries to bind `channel-admin` to a `device`.
- Atom expands the role capabilities during assignment validation.
- The assignment is rejected because `device + delete + resource:channel` is denied.

Example group validation:

- Group `floor-sensors` has a policy that grants `publish` to channels.
- Adding a `device` to `floor-sensors` is allowed.
- If the group later receives `delete` on channels, Atom must validate all current group members and reject the policy if devices would inherit a denied capability.
- If a group already has `delete` on channels, adding a `device` to that group must be rejected.

MVP recommendation:

- Add the `capability_assignment_rules` table.
- Seed global default rules for common entity kinds and common capabilities.
- Support optional tenant-specific rules.
- Allow tenant admins to create stricter tenant-specific deny rules.
- Validate policy creation, role binding, role capability changes, and group membership changes.
- Make deny beat allow.
- Make absolute global deny impossible to override.
- Audit every rejected assignment and every override.
- Keep the PDP unchanged: guardrails prevent unsafe policies from being created, while `/authz/check` continues to evaluate existing policies.

| MAG-7 | Magistrala runtime access checks must call Atom instead of maintaining a separate authorization database. | Must |

---

## API Scope

Atom must expose these API categories:

- Health: service health check.
- Authentication: login, logout, session read, JWKS, signing key rotation.
- Entities: entity CRUD and entity group membership views.
- Credentials: password creation, API key creation, credential listing, credential revocation.
- Tenants: tenant CRUD and lifecycle transitions.
- Groups: group CRUD and membership management.
- Ownerships: entity-to-entity parent/child relations.
- Resources: protected object CRUD.
- Roles: role CRUD and role-capability membership.
- Capabilities: capability CRUD.
- Policies: policy binding CRUD.
- Authorization: single check, bulk check, explain.
- Query endpoints: entity access, resource access, group access, role holders, effective capabilities.
- Audit: audit log listing.
- Admin hygiene: orphan policies, unprotected resources, expiring credentials.
- gRPC: runtime authorization-oriented service interface only for now; management APIs remain HTTP-only unless added later.

## Non-functional Requirements

### Deployment

- Atom must run as a single binary.
- Atom must use PostgreSQL as its only required persistent datastore.
- Migrations must run automatically on startup.
- The service must be configurable through environment variables.

### Security

- Secrets must be hashed with argon2.
- JWTs must be signed and verifiable through published keys.
- Management endpoints must require a manage-capable caller.
- Authorization must be denied by default.
- API keys must not be recoverable after creation.

### Reliability

- Audit failures must not fail authentication or authorization flows.
- Database `RowNotFound` errors must map to not found responses.
- Unique constraint violations must map to conflict responses.
- Tenant foreign key violations must return a clear bad request or conflict-style error.

### Performance

- Authorization checks must avoid per-policy role capability queries.
- Role capabilities must be batch-loaded for authorization evaluation.
- API key authentication must avoid full credential-table scans by using the embedded credential ID.
- List endpoints must support pagination.

### Compatibility

- Existing `resource_id` authorization checks must remain supported.
- New `object_kind` and `object_id` authorization checks must not break the legacy shape.
- Legacy callers may send `resource_kind = "channel"` over HTTP; the API translates this to `object_type = "resource:channel"` at the edge before storing or evaluating. The legacy form must not appear in stored policy bindings, guardrail rules, or audit records.
- HTTP and gRPC authorization semantics must match.

---

## Success Metrics

Atom is successful when:

- Magistrala can model domains, users, clients, channels, groups, and permissions without a separate auth database.
- Runtime services can answer authorization decisions through Atom with deterministic deny-by-default behavior.
- Operators can answer "why denied?", "who can access this?", and "what can this entity access?" without direct SQL.
- Credential creation, revocation, and audit inspection can be done through APIs.
- Tenants can represent Magistrala domain lifecycle states.
- The service can be deployed with Postgres and a small set of environment variables.

## Open Questions

1. **Guardrail validation on large groups (GR-8, GR-9).** When a policy or membership change requires re-validating all existing group members, and the group has tens or hundreds of thousands of members, should validation be synchronous (transactional, but slow) or asynchronous (fast, but unsafe state can exist briefly)? Decide the model and any size threshold.

2. **`require_override` workflow (GR-10).** Is `require_override` a synchronous flag a platform admin sets on the request, or a multi-step approval workflow (request → approval → apply)? Define the API shape and the audit trail.

3. **Session validation on the authz path (AUTH-6).** Validating session liveness in the database on every `/authz/check` is expensive at high QPS. Options: (a) DB lookup per check, (b) short-lived JWT plus refresh token with no per-check DB hit, (c) in-process revocation set refreshed by polling or Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY` for bounded-staleness revocation. Recommendation: (c) with a documented staleness bound (e.g., 1–5 s).

4. **Migrations on startup with multiple replicas.** When N replicas start concurrently, how are migrations serialized? Options: Postgres advisory lock around the migration step, leader-only migration via deployment ordering, or first-replica-wins with retries on the others. This is not a current priority because Postgres replicas are out of scope for now, but keep the question open for future multi-replica deployments. Decide.
