# Atom — Identity & Authorization Service

Lightweight replacement for Keycloak — single Rust binary, single Postgres database. Built for Magistrala IoT platform but generic enough for any cloud-native system.

## Stack

- **Language:** Rust (edition 2021)
- **HTTP framework:** Axum 0.7
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via sqlx 0.7 (dynamic queries; `query_as` with `FromRow`)
- **Auth:** argon2 (password/API key hashing), jsonwebtoken (HS256 JWTs)
- **Runtime:** Tokio (full features)
- **Testing:** `cargo test` (unit tests in-module); `insta` available for snapshot tests

## Project Layout

```
src/
  main.rs              — startup: config, DB pool, migrations, admin bootstrap, router
  config.rs            — Config struct, reads env vars (incl. ADMIN_ENTITY_ID, ADMIN_SECRET)
  state.rs             — AppState (pool + config), cloned into every handler
  routes.rs            — single router wiring all handlers
  error.rs             — AppError enum → HTTP responses; db_err() helper
  audit.rs             — fire-and-forget audit_logs writer; never fails the caller
  auth.rs              — JWT encode/decode, Bearer extraction, AuthContext extractor,
  │                       RequireManage extractor, has_global_manage() helper
  db.rs                — pool creation
  models/
  │  enums.rs          — typed domain enums: EntityKind, EntityStatus, CredentialKind,
  │                       CredentialStatus, SubjectKind, GrantKind, ScopeKind, Effect,
  │                       AuditOutcome — all derive sqlx::Type + serde
  │  entity.rs, group.rs, resource.rs, role.rs, capability.rs,
  │  session.rs, token.rs, policy.rs — domain structs using the typed enums
  identity/
  │  mod.rs
  │  handlers.rs       — Axum handlers for auth + identity endpoints
  │  service.rs        — business logic; writes auth.login audit events
  │  repo.rs           — sqlx queries
  authz/
     mod.rs
     handlers.rs       — Axum handlers; capabilities + policy endpoints use RequireManage
     engine.rs         — PDP: batch-loads role capabilities, evaluates RBAC/ABAC,
     │                    deny-overrides-allow; unit-tested in #[cfg(test)]
     repo.rs           — sqlx queries; capability_ids_for_roles() batch-loads by role array
migrations/
  001_initial.sql      — full schema + action seeds and bootstrap access data
```

## Architecture Patterns

- **Layered:** handler → service/engine → repo. Handlers only do HTTP concerns; business logic lives in service/engine; repo only does DB.
- **AppState** is cheaply cloned (Arc internally via pool) and injected via Axum's `State` extractor.
- **Error handling:** `AppError` is the single error type across all layers. `db_err()` converts `RowNotFound` to `AppError::NotFound`. Postgres unique-violation (code 23505) maps to 409.
- **Typed enums:** all constrained domain fields (`EntityKind`, `Effect`, `ScopeKind`, etc.) are Rust enums deriving `sqlx::Type` + serde. Invalid values are rejected at deserialization — no manual validators in handlers.
- **No special user type:** every principal is an `Entity` with a `kind` field.
- **Online authorization:** tokens carry no permissions; every `POST /authz/check` hits the DB.
- **Audit log:** `audit::write()` is fire-and-forget — it logs failures but never propagates them to the caller. Called from service (login) and handlers (logout, credential ops, authz check).

## Authorization Model (PDP)

Atom's current product model is:

```text
Action = atomic operation
Action Applicability = where an action is valid
Permission Block = scope + actions + effect + conditions
Role = named collection of Permission Blocks
Role Assignment = subject gets a Role
Direct Policy = subject gets one Permission Block directly
```

Action naming is hybrid:
- real stored objects use generic actions, for example `read` on `audit_log`, `manage` or `revoke` on `credential`, `create` or `manage` on `tenant`, and `rotate` on `signing_key`;
- scoped access administration keeps explicit actions: `role.manage` manages roles for a Permission Block scope, and `policy.manage` adds/removes assignments for that scope;
- operation checks keep operation names such as `authz.check`.

Evaluation order in `authz/engine.rs`:
1. Load entity (must be active) and protected object.
2. Resolve action by name and validate it through action applicability.
3. Build effective permissions from role assignments and direct policies, including group inheritance.
4. Batch-load role permission block actions before the binding loop — no per-binding round-trips.
5. For each effective permission: check scope, action coverage, and ABAC conditions.
6. **First DENY match → return denied immediately.**
7. Any ALLOW match → allowed; otherwise → denied.

ABAC conditions: flat JSON object, keys are dot-paths (`entity.attributes.x`, `resource.attributes.y`, `context.z`), values must match exactly (AND logic). Empty `{}` means no conditions — always matches.

## Self-Authorization

Management endpoints are protected by two mechanisms:

**`RequireManage` extractor** (`auth.rs`) — used on `POST/DELETE /capabilities` and `POST/DELETE /policies`. Runs a single DB query (`has_global_manage`) that checks whether the caller holds an `allow` + `scope=all` binding covering the `manage` capability (directly or via a role). Returns 403 otherwise.

**Self-delete check** in `DELETE /entities/:id` — the entity may delete itself; deleting any other entity requires `has_global_manage`.

**Admin bootstrap** — migration `001_initial.sql` seeds:
- Entity `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` (`atom-admin`)
- Role `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002` (`atom-admin`) with all seeded actions
- Role assignment: admin entity → admin role

Set `ADMIN_SECRET` on first boot to create the password credential for `atom-admin`. Subsequent restarts with the same env var are no-ops (credential already exists). To change the admin password, revoke the old credential via the API, then restart with the new secret.

## Database

- All PKs are UUIDs (`gen_random_uuid()` via pgcrypto).
- `entities` and `groups` have a composite unique index on `(name, tenant_id)` — name uniqueness is per-tenant.
- `actions` unique on `name`; `action_applicability` defines valid object kind/type pairs.
- Migrations run automatically on startup via `sqlx::migrate!("./migrations")`. New migrations go in `migrations/NNN_<name>.sql`.
- GIN indexes on `attributes` JSONB columns in `entities` and `resources`.

## API Key Format

`atom_<32-hex-credential-id>_<64-hex-secret>`

The credential ID is embedded in the key for O(1) lookup without a full-table scan. Secret is argon2-hashed; shown only once on creation.

## Rust Patterns & Conventions

### Error handling
- Use `?` for propagation throughout. At external boundaries (DB, JWT, argon2) convert with `.map_err(|e| AppError::...)` or `db_err()`.
- Never `unwrap()` in non-test code unless the invariant is truly compiler-provable. Use `expect("reason")` only when you can justify why it can't fail.
- `anyhow` is for `main` and startup code only. All library/handler code uses `AppError`.

### Enums and exhaustive matching
- Never use a `_` wildcard catch-all when matching on project enums (`Effect`, `ScopeKind`, `GrantKind`, etc.). The compiler will catch unhandled variants when new ones are added — that's the point.
- Wildcard is acceptable only for third-party or `std` error/status types where exhaustiveness isn't a goal.

### Borrowing
- Prefer `&str` over `&String` and `&[T]` over `&Vec<T>` in function signatures unless you need ownership.
- Avoid `.clone()` in hot paths (request handling, PDP evaluation). Clone is fine at startup and in tests.

### Iterators over loops
- Prefer `.iter().filter().map().collect()` chains over `for` loops with `push`. Use `for` only when side effects or early returns make a chain unreadable.
- `.collect::<HashSet<_>>()` then `.into_iter().collect::<Vec<_>>()` is the idiomatic dedup pattern (used in engine for role_ids).

### Async
- Never call blocking I/O inside an async function without `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. DB calls via sqlx are non-blocking by design.
- Fire-and-forget tasks (e.g. audit writes that don't need a result) can use `.await` inline — `tokio::spawn` is only warranted when the work must outlive the request or truly run concurrently.

### Derives — conventional ordering
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Serialize, Deserialize, sqlx::Type)]
```
Order: `Debug`, `Clone`, `Copy` (if applicable), `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Hash` (if applicable), then serde, then sqlx/axum traits.

### Tests
- Unit tests go in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block in the same file as the code under test.
- Integration tests that need a real DB go in `tests/` and require `DATABASE_URL` to be set; add a `#[ignore]` attribute if you want `cargo test` to skip them by default.
- Use `insta::assert_json_snapshot!` for JSON response assertions.
- Never assert on exact `Uuid` or timestamp values — assert on structure and relevant fields only.

### Clippy
Run before committing:
```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

## Development

```bash
# Start Postgres only
docker-compose up postgres -d

# Run (auto-applies migrations)
cargo run

# Type check only
cargo check

# Run unit tests (no DB required)
cargo test

# Lint
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Live reload (requires cargo-watch)
cargo watch -x run
```

Environment variables: copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Required: `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET` (32+ chars).

Optional: `ADMIN_SECRET` — if set, bootstraps the admin entity's password on first boot.
Optional: `ADMIN_ENTITY_ID` — override the seeded admin UUID (default `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`).

## Key Invariants

- DENY always overrides ALLOW — never change this without explicit discussion.
- Default deny — no matching allow policy means denied.
- `db_err()` must be used when converting sqlx errors in repo functions so `RowNotFound` maps correctly.
- API keys are one-time reveal — the plaintext secret is never stored; once the creation response is sent it cannot be recovered.
- No `PUT /groups/:id` — groups are immutable after creation (name/tenant change would break policy references).
- Enum variants must stay in sync with DB CHECK constraints — changing a variant's serialized name is a schema-breaking change requiring a migration.
- `audit::write()` must never be `?`-propagated — it is always fire-and-forget to avoid blocking auth decisions on audit failures.
- The `capability_ids_for_roles` batch query must be called before the binding loop in `engine::evaluate` — do not reintroduce per-binding role lookups.
